## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Identified NULL values in the dataset.
- Deleted records containing NULL values to ensure data integrity.

### 2. **Data Exploration**
- Counted total sales.
- Counted the number of unique customers.

### 3. **Key Business Problems & Answers**

#### Q1: Sales on a Specific Date
Retrieve all columns for sales made on `'2022-11-05'`.

#### Q2: Category-Based Query
Find transactions where the category is `'Clothing'` and the quantity sold is more than 4 in November 2022.

#### Q3: Total Sales by Category
Calculate the total sales (`total_sale`) for each category.

#### Q4: Average Age in 'Beauty' Category
Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the `'Beauty'` category.

#### Q5: High-Value Transactions
Find transactions where the `total_sale` is greater than 1000.

#### Q6: Transactions by Gender and Category
Calculate the total number of transactions by each gender in each category.

#### Q7: Best Selling Month
Determine the month with the highest average sales for each year.

#### Q8: Top 5 Customers
Identify the top 5 customers based on total sales.

#### Q9: Unique Customers by Category
Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

#### Q10: Orders by Shift
Classify transactions into shifts (`Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`) and count the number of orders for each shift.

## Example Queries

### Create Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### Data Cleaning
```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantiy IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### Sample Analysis Query
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS No_of_uni_custo
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```
